If you want to build the project you can follow the steps below :

- Ensure you have ``GCC`` installed
- ( For ``Windows`` users install ``MinGw`` )
- And then just run ``make compile`` (`` MinGw32-make compile``  for windows users ) command this will replace the binary in the output folder that match your OS
